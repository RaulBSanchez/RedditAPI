PSA - The Sun will now be a banned source on this subreddit.,40022,af9lvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/af9lvk/psa_the_sun_will_now_be_a_banned_source_on_this/,2832,1547343501.0,"&#x200B;

From now on The Sun will no longer be a source allowed on the sub.

The Sun as a publication has been boycotted by 70 sets of fans of English clubs over the coverage of Hillsborough and other pieces of coverage. Clubs themselves have also joined in this protest by banning the publication from conferences.

We firmly believe that nothing of value will be lost here. The news covered will generally be found at other sites instead.

This ban is not related to the quality and reliability of content from The Sun, and we are not looking to ban any sources based on those criteria. The reliability and content quality of sources should still be governed by the community using upvotes and downvotes.  


We'll update everyone in a few days about the rest of the meta thread, just thought this is worth its own post first as it would obviously dominate the comments, which is understandable. ",2019-01-12 20:38:21

edit: Would like to point out, since it was mentioned by /u/Trydson. /r/sports is the largest overall sports subreddit there is, but it is also a default subreddit that needs to be opted out of instead of joined. I think it was still a massive achievement considering this.

/r/Soccer - 578,000

/r/Nfl - 577,000

/r/Nba - 531,000

/r/Baseball - 375,000

/r/Hockey - 318,000

I apologize if I left one of the sport subs that you love off the list, but I was looking for the other major big players.

Double Edit: Some extra stats provided by iVarum.

Sub Traffic Stats provide that info. It weeds out the dead accounts which are part of Subscriber count.

https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/about/traffic

https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/about/traffic

Basically meaning. r/soccer has twice the activity that r/nfl has.

r/soccer gets almost a Million Pageviews Daily to 400-500K for r/nfl.

Daily Uniques r/soccer gets 125K Daily to 110K range for r/nfl

Monthly Pageviews of 40-50 Million for r/soccer to 20-30 Million for r/nfl

Monthly Uniques of 1.5-2.5 Million for r/soccer to 1-1.5 Million for r/nfl.

I did not really want to make this an nfl vs soccer thing, was just more proud that /r/soccer finally took the #1 seed. Thanks for the extra stats people have thrown at me though.

I've got the job as Data Analyst at a club i manage on Football Manager,23425,dy8m24,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/dy8m24/ive_got_the_job_as_data_analyst_at_a_club_i/,997,1574136458.0,"Hello everyone. My name is Andrej Pavlović i am 22 years old and i have been working a full month as a Data Analyst for FC Bežanija. I post weekly updates at r/footballmanagergames but i decided to share this with you guys since this is biggest football subreddit.

Bežanija is a club that has been relegated from 2nd to 6th tier of Serbian football due to financial troubles. Before that Bežanija was known as only team from Serbia besides Partizan and Red Star that have remained in top 2 leagues for 17 years.

This is where i step in, i've sent them my achievements on FM with Bežanija to their Facebook page, i've got the number of the director from there and i sent him the same message. He called me right after that, we had a friendly chat, i said i know a bit about data analysis and statistics and that i would love a opportunity at a club to test my knowledge, he then asked me if i would like to come to do a report on a game, of course i said yes! It has been a full month now as i said, and Bežanija didn't lose a game since i am at the club (6 games 5 wins 1 draw). We climbed the table, from 13th to 6th in just 6 games.

\***My achievements with them in football manager in 16 years are**:11 Serbian Super League titles, 6 Serbian Cups, Champions League Semi-Finalist and Europa League Semi-Finalist.

Since i am at the club i started doing bits here and there besides Data Analysis, i also renovated their Website [www.fcbezanija.com](https://www.fcbezanija.com) , i am the guy behind their social media now, instagram is my main focus, if you could follow us that would mean a lot! For me and for the players and staff>>>>   [**https://www.instagram.com/fcbezanija/**](https://www.instagram.com/fcbezanija/)

I also started looking for sponsors since we didn't have any, and i found one! It is a small sponsorship (50 euros a month) but it is something to start with.

Here are some pictures of our new kits, with our brand new sponsors i found for the club

Also you probably wondered by now, what is my main job!? It is data Analysis and here are some graphs i translated for you >

I try to focus on attacking/ defensive zones so we can really see where are we weak and strong.

&#x200B;

I forgot to mention that i volunteer for the club, as all the players and staff.We do this out of pure love for the game and the club.If you liked our and my story you can help us by donating to our PATREON page that i've made for us to gather money for our main expenses and also to buy equipment in the future (balls, nets, markers, bibs/vests) also none of our players are paid, something we would like to change in the future. You can become a Patron here . It would mean so much>>>

31': Chance for Southampton! Probably won't matter in the scheme of things but at least they're doing something now, unfortunately for them Valery's shot is saved by Schmeichel

33': Terrible mishit shot by Vardy. We'll be charitable and say all the rain threw him off

35': Barnes with the shot! Gunn lets the ball come off him and slip past him but he slows it enough that he can scramble backwards and stop it on the line.

39': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL LEICESTER!! A beautiful long floated pass across the box to *Ayoze Pérez*, who volleys it in for his second of the night!**](https://streamable.com/v0jdn)

45': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL LEICESTER!! Finally a goal for *Jamie Vardy*! It's about four minutes of sustained possession for the Foxes, the Saints defense made about three desperate blocks but the ball finally made it to Vardy right in front of goal where he can't miss!**](https://streamable.com/onl9u)

46': We're back. Yay?

48': SAVE! Jamie Vardy steals the ball from the defense and fires, Gunn just manages to get in the way. Leicester apparently not looking to slow down.

48': Evans flicks the ball at goal, not with any power. Saved by Gunn.

57': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL LEICESTER!! *Ayoze Pérez* has his hat trick. A looped pass over the top, Pérez chests it down and beats the keeper one-on-one. This is comedy territory now.**](https://streamja.com/1M7r)

69': Redmond actually forces a fine stop from Schmeichel.

72': [](#icon-sub) Leicester substitution: *Marc Albrighton* on for *Harvey Barnes*

**MATCH EVENTS:**

**0'** Harry is only 6th in line for the throne so this one does not have the same buzz as William's Wedding who's definitely going to be the future King but the people are thrilled nevertheless.  

**0'** The Rolls-Royce Phantom IV is polished and should appear soon.

**0'** We just saw Sir Elton John on the bench. Hard to tell how bummed he is to be not on the pitch right now.

**1'** The Music has started. Shit's about to get real. 

**1'** We see Harry coming on now accompanied by William. Both looking sharp af.

**5'** And There is the car with the opponent and her mum. It's getting heated.

**11'** First great scene by Markle near the goal, the crowd is getting ecstatic!

**20'** Only disappointment so far is the performance of William's hairline. 

**25'** Here we have Charles trying to step out of Elizabeth's shadow with a slide tackle just before she's entering the scene.

**30'** One could argue that GB's defense line is looking a bit too harmless today, like little girls with flowers.

**31'** Quite remarkable display of stamina by Prince Philip, he hasn't fallen asleep yet although he's already 5 minutes in the game. That's amazing considering he's 428 years old!

**33'** Markle looking great in the new home kit. You can get it in the team store now for a discount of just £100,000!

**40'** Harry and Meghan have a long talk with the official right now, I feel like they might get carded. Difficult situation for both of them since the match is likely getting more physical later on.

**42'** Prince George holding back the urge to speak out against Harry marrying a pleb.

**45'** ⚽ **Goooal! In a freaky turn of events Markle and Harry both beautifully score within seconds! Harry confidently declares ""I will"" and so does she. The new score is 1-1.**

**56'** Passionate solo by Reverend Curry even though his teammates look like they would like him to pass the ball a bit earlier.

**61'** Curry going for the looong build up right now starts talking about the human discovery of fire.

**64'** Great choreo now by the Gospel Choir. The Queen is probably delighted they renounced the use of pyrotechnics today.

**67'** Harry and Meghan with a heated exchange again and Harry getting close...

**68'** ⚽ **Goooal! Harry slides the ring on her finger nervously but it's good!**

**70'** ⚽ **Goooal! And Meghan on the other side with the counter. You can see she's done it before. Great Display! New score is 2-2.**

**86'** Another great presentation of the musical ultras echoing through the stadium now, so far the atmosphere has been top-notch regardless of the tranquil looking crowd. 

**91'** Bah gawd! [That's Agent 47's music!](https://youtu.be/N42MQJX4KoY?t=2h15s)

**95'** Meghan and Harry leave the box for the first time today. The fans are excited as it seems they're getting ready for their lap of honour.

**96'** On a side note - the Black Panther tribal calls have also made it to this final today.

**100'** Great run by the horses, some say they have lungs like Park Ji-sung.

**115'** Duchess Meghan still looking a bit nervous doing the signature royalty wave to the peasants but she'll get there. She sure looks happy to be here.

**144'** We are in the final minutes of this match and I would like to thank you all for the courtesy of having me. I declare Love as Man of the Match and I expect the celebrations to turn into riots in the sheets of Windsor tonight. So stay safe everyone. Goodbye! <3 

**Final score is 2-2 but I'm sure Prince Harry will score again many times in the near future.**",2018-05-19 14:18:12

[](//#net-big) **MATCH EVENTS**

**00'** [](//#whistle) Just about ready for kickoff. Remember, if anything's wrong with the thread, please ping my username or send me a message!

**02'** [](//#info) Early free kick here for Germany in a great position as Toni Kroos is barged off the ball unfairly. It was another attempt at a cute free kick from the Germans but doesn't come off.

**04'** [](//#info) And Argentina counter immediately, as Higuain's shot is dragged wide. Good early chances for both teams! The shape of the match is already clear - the Germans comfortable in possession, but Argentina look set to counter.

**09'** [](//#info) Dangerous moment for Germany as Messi tears the right side apart, but he can't find a teammate with his final pass in the box.

**18'** [](//#info) Ouch! Kramer is on the floor after having taken a heavy (accidental) shoulder to the face. Interesting to see what will happen here - a reminder that Kramer started this match as Khedira got injured in the warm-up.

**21'** [](//#info) Higuain, Higuain, Higuain! The Napoli man is *gifted* a one-on-one by a poor header from Kroos, but he's completely missed the target! You can't miss those, not here!

**29'** [](//#yellow) Schweinsteiger picks up the first yellow card of the match after bringing down Lavezzi. The free kick is played short, but doesn't come to much.

**30'** [](//#flag) Higuain has the ball in the back of the net but he's strayed way, way offside and the goal is rightly chalked off! The striker should have done better, but the German defenders didn't shower themselves in credit either.

**31'** [](//#sub) Kramer, meanwhile, has not been able to recover and his World Cup final comes to an end. Chelsea's Andre Schürrle comes on for him.

**34'** [](//#yellow) Fairly outrageous challenge from Höwedes on Zabaleta earns him a yellow. No complaints from the German and he might consider himself a bit lucky...

**40'** [](//#info) Messi runs through just about everyone but Boateng is there at the death. The match's frantic early pace is showing no signs of slowing.

**45'** [](//#info) A German corner comes in and Höwedes smashes it into the post - could he have done better with that? The rebound goes straight to Müller, but he's offside.

**45'** [](//#clock) After 2 added minutes, the first half is brought to an end. It's had just about everything, barring a (legitimate) goal - hopefully we'll see that plus more of the same after the break.

^___________________________________ **HT** ^___________________________________ 

**45'** [](//#sub) The injury-ravaged Sergio Agüero is making an appearance. Lavezzi has come off for him - bit of a risky move from Sabella.

**45'** [](//#whistle) We're back out and ready to go for another 45. Maybe the last 45 minutes of the World Cup, if one of these almosts finds its way home.

**47'** [](//#info) Argentina are the ones who've started better and ohhhh Messi. He's clean through, but his shot whistles narrowly wide of the far post.

**57'** [](//#info) Couple of... curious decisions from the referee in the last few minutes, calling fouls that could've either gone uncalled or been given to the other team. Germany's ball now, though, having worked their way back into the half.

**64'** [](//#yellow) Mascherano miscontrols and fouls Klose to stop him capitalising from the error. He'll take the yellow, first Argentinian player to be booked on the night.

**65'** [](//#yellow) Agüero doesn't want Mascherano to be lonely and so charges into Schweinsteiger rashly. He's promptly booked too.

**70'** [](//#info) The pace and sharpness of the first half hasn't quite carried through after the break, as both teams find themselves getting a bit scrappy in the final third.

**75'** [](//#info) Messi carves out a chance after working his way around the German box, but his strike sails wide. 15 minutes left, and it's unclear which team will be able to find the moment of magic.

**78'** [](//#sub) Rodrigo Palacio is Sabella's roll of the die here, and Higuain will be the man to come off. He might yet regret his big, big miss in the first half.

**82'** [](//#info) The Germans playing well in the last few minutes but as Özil tees up Kroos for a trademark drive, the Bayern man tamely slides it wide. Not long left!

**86'** [](//#sub) Gago comes on for Perez. That'll be Sabella's third and final move, while the Germans still have two substitutes remaining as extra-time closes in.

**87'** [](//#sub) Löw makes one of those subs now, as Mario Götze comes on for Klose, the tournament's all-time record goalscorer.

**90'** [](//#clock) It could've all been over by now, but after 3 added minutes the teams remain level. Off to extra time we go, then - for the third World Cup final in a row.

^___________________________________ **FT** ^___________________________________ 

**090'** [](//#whistle) Goalless still, then, as we go into extra time. 30 more minutes - at least - left in this match, let's see what these tired legs are capable of.

**091'** [](//#info) Just 30 seconds into it and Schürrle almost finds the moment! Denied by a sharp save from Romero, and the Argentinian counter-attack is quickly snuffed out.

**097'** [](//#info) Palacio with a huge chance from close range but he tries to outsmart Neuer by lifting it over him, and his effort sails well wide of the mark!

**105'** [](//#clock) It's all German possession in extra time so far but still nothing to separate these teams. Penalties looming large now, but 15 minutes left to do something about that.

**109'** [](//#info) Schweinsteiger's taken a fair few heavy challenges, most notably a couple of recent ones from Mascherano and Agüero - both of whom have already been booked. The German is bleeding. Careful!

**113'** [](//#ball) **GOAL GERMANY!** Mario Götze has scored! Schürrle plays him in with a clever dinked cross and Götze provides the deadly finish that this match has been missing!

**120'** [](//#sub) Özil is replaced by Mertesacker. There will be just 2 minutes added on to this second half of extra time. Germany on the brink! 

**120'** [](//#clock) And that's it! A last minute Messi free kick comes to nothing, and the referee blows for full time. Germany are the Champions!

Edin Dzeko will be joining us today at around **17:00 Rome time (16:00 UK, 11am EST)** to answer your questions. He might arrive a little earlier, or a little later, depending on when he finishes training.

To allow Edin to get through as many questions as possible, we are opening the thread up now so you can start to submit them. Please keep in mind that, while we will give Edin free rein to answer what he wants as much as possible, this is a Roma AMA and so we will try to focus a fair share of the topics on the Giallorossi!

Dzeko joined Roma in the summer of 2015, and is currently ninth on the list of the club's all-time leading goalscorers. He was Serie A top goalscorer in 2016-17, and last season became the first player to score at least 50 goals in three of Europe's 'Big Five' leagues (Bundesliga, Premier League, Serie A).

You can ask him about that or... well, anything else you can think of really (you all know how this works at this point).

Thanks!

**UPDATE:** Edin is here! Proof: [https://twitter.com/ASRomaEN/status/1065639285372665856](https://twitter.com/ASRomaEN/status/1065639285372665856)

**UPDATE:** The AMA is now finished. Apologies if Edin wasn't able to answer your question, although hopefully similar ground was covered in one of the other responses. Thanks for having Edin - and hopefully this is the first of a few AMAs to come in the not-too-distant future! Daje Roma!",2018-11-22 13:46:01

# Let Iranian Women In

[**https://www.change.org/p/fifa-let-iranian-women-in**](https://www.change.org/p/fifa-let-iranian-women-in)

&#x200B;

Sadly I couldn't find an English source for her death. It was confirmed over an hour ago by many sources, here is from Manoto News. For one in Persian. [https://twitter.com/ManotoNews/status/1171158186633629697](https://twitter.com/ManotoNews/status/1171158186633629697)

We have players inside Iran who defended her after she set herself on fire, that defended the right of women, that said these laws are medieval. Like our own captain Masoud Shojaei. Sadly the regime inside Iran is a Theocracy, that doesn't care. FIFA can if they are serious force them to change, because if they don't these guys will never change seeing how they rule over their people with fear.

A while back 3 women were arrested for removing their hijab and they got a sentence of 55+ years in jail combined. This regime has runied the lives of every Iranian who isn't either in their pockets(economically or an Islamist like the Mullahs and their followers who control the country).

Only international pressure can get them to change hence why I decided to post this here. Please FIFA Do something!

Context: Women aren't allowed into the Stadiums in the Islamic Republic of Iran because the government the so-called Islamic Republic is a theocracy that has tried its best to uphold a gender apartheid system since the day they got in power in 1979. The Iranian people like this girl are the victims of the cruel and horrible regime that has ruined the lives of many Iranians my relatives included

I ask of you admins of Soccer, please don't remove this. We need to put pressure on FIFA so that they are forced to act on their empty threats towards the regime in Iran and its football federation.

You can read more about this here in English:  [https://en.radiofarda.com/a/football-stars-in-iran-voice-support-for-female-fan-who-set-fire-to-herself/30151580.html](https://en.radiofarda.com/a/football-stars-in-iran-voice-support-for-female-fan-who-set-fire-to-herself/30151580.html)

Edit: I am not asking for a war, I am not asking for the world to give Iran a regime change. Only Iranians can do that. And hopefully they will some day. What I am asking for is that FIFA does something to force these backward buffoons to treat women as human beings when it comes to football. They can do it. They can actually force them to do it.

Thanks for upvoting.

**SECOND EDIT!: READ: THIS WAS CONFIRMED WHILE I WAS SLEEPING**

**""** Although Iranian media reported that she died on September 9, a source inside Iran told IranWire that the woman, who has now been named as ""Sahar K"", had died ""three days ago,"" on September 6. The authorities had forced her family to remain silent for “national security” reasons and blocked people from visiting the hospital ""

More here: [https://iranwire.com/en/features/6291](https://iranwire.com/en/features/6291)

Her Hashtags are trending among Iranians on Twitter and Instagram. #دختر\_آبی (Blue Girl, Esteghlal wears blue) and as well as the hashtag Boycot the Stadiums. Later today Iran has a game

Third edit: Some people have sent me messages claiming this is fake news brought to you by the Israel and I don't know what lobby. That I will remove this post when it's debunked. Here you go. BBC Persian confirmed it.  I hope you enjoy being a person without any kind of humanity. [https://www.instagram.com/p/B2NRRMSJ5PK/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2NRRMSJ5PK/)

**THIRD UPDATE**

**Farshid Bagheri player of Esteghlal FC has shown his support to the girl by posting on instagram.**  Which makes him the third footballer that I have seen show support to this so far. First was Masoud Shojaei captain of the National Team, second was Vouria Ghafouri player in national team and also Esteghlal FC [https://www.instagram.com/p/B2OGvZGB\_E5/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2OGvZGB_E5/)

**Iranian actors are also posting posts in support of the girl, and women overall. Example from Ehsan Karamy**  [https://www.instagram.com/ehsaankaramy/](https://www.instagram.com/ehsaankaramy/)

Another player defends the girl and shows his support. **Mehdi Rahmati** former national team goalkeeper of Iran and whom also used to play for Esteghlal. Check his story on his page:  [https://www.instagram.com/mehdirahmati111/](https://www.instagram.com/mehdirahmati111/)

**FOURHT UPDATE: Ali Karimi Iranian Superstar which probably everyone on this sub above the age of 30 remembers posts in support of the girl.**  [https://twitter.com/porshoor/status/1171328154130165762/photo/1](https://twitter.com/porshoor/status/1171328154130165762/photo/1)

**EDIT ALI KARIMI IS CALLING FOR PEOPLE TO BOYCOTT THE STADIUMS**

Another famous actress from Inside Iran does it as well.  [https://www.instagram.com/parastoosalehi56/](https://www.instagram.com/parastoosalehi56/)

Player of the Rival team Perspolis and also former National Team Player Seyed Jalal Hossein shows his support to the girl on his story.  [https://www.instagram.com/seyedjalal/](https://www.instagram.com/seyedjalal/)

Another Iranian actress joins showing support for the girl.  [https://www.instagram.com/p/B2OQ1CwnTsb/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2OQ1CwnTsb/)

**Famous football cartoonis Omar Momani who is Jordanian shows his support by drawing this.**  [https://twitter.com/omomani/status/1171282088173154311](https://twitter.com/omomani/status/1171282088173154311)

Hossein Mahini former national team player also showing his support.   [https://twitter.com/HosseinMahini/status/1171324699285942272](https://twitter.com/HosseinMahini/status/1171324699285942272)

Internation media is catching up [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle\_east/iranian-female-soccer-fan-dies-after-setting-herself-on-fire/2019/09/10/8b4a7d30-d3a9-11e9-8924-1db7dac797fb\_story.html#click=https://t.co/naLQdcrziI](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iranian-female-soccer-fan-dies-after-setting-herself-on-fire/2019/09/10/8b4a7d30-d3a9-11e9-8924-1db7dac797fb_story.html#click=https://t.co/naLQdcrziI)

Everyone inside Iran on Instagram is showing support to the girl. They are all outraged at the regime for being responsible for this. From former national team players to ordinary people and actors etc. So please leave you ""Ah these people are stupid"" comments out of this place thank you. The Iranian people aren't like the Islamists who rule over them. Anyone that knows a thing or two about Iran knows this.

I want to once again thank you all. Im seeing that this is getting global attention now. People inside Iran are furious everyone from Football players to Actors and ordinary people. Thank you for helping us spread these news to the global stage. Also you guys who golded/Silverd. Thanks as well but you don't need to waste money on this post. Just upvote is enough <3

**Almost every single Iranian football player that has played for the National Team since the 80's to today that is active on Instagram has shown support towards her and Iranian women overall. Karim Ansifard posted right after today's game against Hong Kong where he scored the 2-0 goal. Saeed Ezzatollahi just posted a video in support of the women. Abedzadeh that was the GK in the 1998 world cup as well. The Legend Ali Daei, The Asian Maradona Ali Karimi. You have to understand that people don't like this. They are against these laws of the regime.**",2019-09-10 01:42:57

Hi, u/BanterBoat here, and welcome to the one of the two final games of Group F! The ""Group of Death"" can see any of the four sides qualify or be eliminated, so there's everything to fight for at this stage of the competition! 

Germany look fierce after an epic late comeback win vs Sweden (courtesy of Toni Kroos), while South Korea will be looking to get some points on the board after a spirited performance against Mexico (with the obligatory Son banger). Anything can happen, so hopefully we'll see a little bit of World Cup magic for an all-time classic match we'll tell our kids about.

Insight:

- According to [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-world-cup-predictions/), Germany has an 87% chance at progression, while Korea stands at a mighty 1%.
- Germany need a win that equals or betters Sweden (should they win) in order to advance; Korea must beat Germany AND Mexico must beat Sweden, givetn hat at least one of the results is by a margin of two goals
- Interestingly enough, although the Group after D is E, Group F's games are being played earlier than Group E (if there's some kind of reason, please let me know)

Match Updates:

-5': And the players walk onto the Kazan Arena listening to the Seven Nation Army, national anthems to ensue.

0': Kickoff! Germany in the turquoise, Korea in the red!

2': Ozil, of all people, stops a dangerous Korean attack. Great stuff from him.

6': Reus puts in a first-time cross but it amounts to nothing.

9': [](#icon-yellow-big) Jung Wooyoung commits a hard foul and gets booked.

11': Moon Seonmin fouls outside the box but the German freekick is headed away.

16': Koo Jacheol goes down in the box after an awkward fall following a German corner. Thankfully he looks alright to go on.

19': CHANCE! Jung Wooyoung's freekick forces a Neuer error, but he clears for a corner before Korea can capitalize!

23': [](#icon-yellow-big) Lee Jaesong is shown the yellow card.

25': CHANCE! Son gets a volley effort in the box but blasts it wide!

28': CHANCE! Werner puts in a powerful cross but its headed well away by Yun Youngsun, who gets a little treatment.

33': CHANCE! Germany gets a dangerous counter off, but it's called for a handball foul on Reus.

37': Germany have been pressuring Korea from all angles here, but Korea are just barely [stayin alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_izvAbhExY).

39': CHANCE! Germany's cross gives Khedira space, but Korea put enough pressure for it to eventually fall into the keeper's hands. 

43': CHANCE! Germany get a lethal shot that cannons off the post, but unfortunately for them a foul was committed before the fact.

45': CHANCE! Son gets into the box but his dribbling attempt ends in a goal kick.

45+3': And that's the half.

HT: [](#sprite6-p90) 0 - 0 [](#sprite6-p64)
=====
_____

45': And the second half starts.

46': CHANCE! Jung Wooyoung goes for a longshot but its weak and too central for Neuer who catches it easily.

48': CHANCE! Kimmich gets in a wonderful cross which is met with a great header, but Jo Hyunwoo makes an amazing save! Korea given a lifeline!

49': [](#icon-yellow-big) Moon Seonmin booked for a rash challenge.

50': Sweden score in their match; Korea and Germany are both in danger of elimination!

51': CHANCE! Werner has an open volley but he strikes wide.

55': Koo Jacheol down again, and it doesn't look good for him.

56': [](#icon-sub) Koo Jacheol comes off for Hwang Heechan.

58': [](#icon-sub) Sami Khedira comes off for Mario Gomez.

61': CHANCE! Werner gets a cross in after a dubious no-call, but the play that follows leads to a wasted corner.

62': CHANCE! Son tries a shot but it's high and wide.

62': Sweden scores again! Mexico 0, Sweden 2, and if Germany remain scoreless they will not advance alongside South Korea!

63': [](#icon-sub) Leon Goretzka comes off for Thomas Muller.

65': [](#icon-yellow-big) Son receives a yellow card for simulation.

66': CHANCE! Moon Seonmin has an amazing chance but he can't pull the trigger!

68': CHANCE! Gomez gets a clean header off, but it's central and held well by Jo Hyunwoo.

69': [](#icon-sub) Moon Seonmin comes off for Ju Sejong.

71': CHANCE! Germany again gets a close range effort, but it's saved and cleared!

78': [](#icon-sub) Jonas Hector comes off for Julian Brandt.

80': CHANCES AT BOTH ENDS, THIS GAME IS REALLY HEATING UP!

82': CHANCE! Muller's flick is good, but no one can latch onto it and it's a Korean goal kick.

83': CHANCE! Marco Reus' shot is beautiful but wide.

87': ANOTHER CHANCE! Hummels gets a header but it's over! Chances at both sides, such end-to-end football, what an amazing game for the neutrals despite no goals!

88': CHANCE! BUT JO HYUNWOO WITH ANOTHER SAVE!

89': Oh dear, [Lee Yong has been hit in the crotch](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/qvkbmy), that's gotta be painful.

90': The German bench looks distraught. 6 minutes of additional time.

90+3': VAR LOOKS TO CHECK IF THERE IS CONTACT...

90+3': [GOAL!!!!!!!!!!!!](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6mxj40) SOUTH KOREA AT THE DEATH! KIM YOUNGGWON!

90+5': CHANCE! Muller's flick on gets to Hummels but it's over!

90+6': [GOAL!!!!!!](https://streamja.com/pMd6) SON! KOREA UP 2!

FT': THAT'S THE GAME!

Teams are in the tunnel, which means kickoff is imminent!

1' **KICKOFF!** Underway from the Spanish capital!

4' Benzema wins the first corner of the game. Cleared by the first man

4' **MADRID HIT THE BAR!** The second ball in is headed by Varane off the woodwork!

7' [](#sprite1-p22) **[GOAL AJAX!! Their first attack of the game and the Dutch level the tie at 2-2 through Hakim Ziyech!!](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/vbxvay)** via /u/herbaldreamin 

10' Important to remember that Madrid still hold the away goal tiebreaker. But should Ajax score a second, that will be gone

14' Modric is furious with the linesman as he rules the Croatian fouled de Jong

16' Kroos drags a first time shot wide. Should have done better. Goal kick.

17' The ball deflects off of Blind and Madrid have a corner. Cleared by De Ligt.

26' **Mazraoui is booked** for a foul on Vinicius. He'll miss the next game should Ajax advance

29' And so he does. **Bale replaces Vazquez**

30' **Carvajal is booked** for a foul on Neres

31' Madrid counter through Vinicius, who shoots into the side netting

32' The Brazilian seems to also have injured himself in the process of shooting...

34' Vinicius is in tears on the endline as he's being treated. Looks like he'll play no further part

35' **SAVE COURTOIS ON ZIYECH!** Neres gets to the rebound and wins a corner!

35' **Asensio replaces Vinicius**

42' Ziyech tries one from range but it's blocked

50' Benzema turns and shoots high

51' **SAVE COURTOIS ON VAN DE BEEK!** It would've been a third assist for Tadic had that been scored

53' Bale wins a corner for Madrid. Headed away by Blind

59' Benzema does superbly to beat his defender then shoots wide. A shame

60' Mazraoiu's cross is into the side netting

72' [](#sprite1-p22) **[GOAL AJAX!! Lasse Schone curls in the free kick!! AMAZING!! 4-1](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/qkvlqe)** via /u/herbaldreamin

Since that day, there have been 15 editions of the UEFA Champions League, and all of the champion teams can be sorted into 4 different categories:

1. **Cristiano Ronaldo's team**:   
Manchester United 2007-08, Real Madrid 2013-14, Real Madrid 2015-16, Real Madrid 2016-17, Real Madrid 2017-18

2. **Lionel Messi's team**:  
Barcelona 2005-06, Barcelona 2008-09, Barcelona 2010-11, Barcelona 2014-15

3. **Team led by a manager with past success in UEFA competitions**:  
Liverpool 2004-05 (Rafa Benítez), AC Milan 2006-07 (Carlo Ancelotti), Internazionale 2009-10 (José Mourinho), Bayern München 2012-13 (Jupp Heynckes)

4. **English team led at the start of the season by a Portuguese manager who had recently won the Europa League, who was sacked due to underwhelming league results, and replaced by a former player who formerly had very little success as a Premier League manager**:  
Chelsea 2011-12 (André Villas-Boas/Roberto di Matteo)

As we approach the quarter-finals, we can now clearly see which of the remaining teams fall into each category:

1. Juventus
2. Barcelona 
3. Manchester City (Pep Guardiola) 
4. Manchester United (José Mourinho/Ole Gunnar Solskjær)

Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Porto, and Ajax don't fall into any of those categories - so it appears highly unlikely that we'll see one of them as the eventual champions.",2019-04-09 13:13:45

[](#icon-net-big) **MATCH EVENTS**

1': We're off!

3': First shot from Heath goes easily into the keeper's hands.

4': Another save, Mewis fires and this time Charoenying spills it but is able to run and jump on it to prevent a rebound goal.

5': Morgan scores! No, taken out by the offside flag. Keeper missed a catch, Horan headed the ball to Morgan for a tap-in but Morgan was offside.

11': Mewis hits Heath's cross over the goal.

12': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL UNITED STATES!! O'Hara fires an aerial cross to *Alex Morgan* who hits a tap-in header at her near side!**](https://streamja.com/Ev5q)

20': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL UNITED STATES!!! *Rose Lavelle* gets a long pass, she has options but she takes it herself from distance and puts it in the near side! Big failure by the keeper who got two hands on it but couldn't push it out.**](https://streamja.com/j4k3)

23': Mewis was clearly just pulled down by the shirt. Ref didn't give anything, but it looks like VAR is checking... still no penalty. Should've been given IMO

29': A shot! From Thailand! Thongsombut gets it on target from outside the box but Naeher makes an easy catch.

32': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL UNITED STATES!! A free kick goes low into the box, it pinballs around and then falls right to *Lindsay Horan* who smashes it into the roof!**](https://streamja.com/yGe5)

35': [](#icon-sub) Thailand substitution: *Pikul Khueanpet* on for *Wilaiporn Boothduang*

45+1': Dunne shoots from a narrow angle, gets blocked at the near post.

45+2': SAVE! The keeper makes a good solid block on a header, then the defense makes about a dozen blocks, then Horan is taken down in the box! Penalty? VAR sayyyyyyys... no

**HT United States 3-0 Thailand** US as dominant as expected. Now just to see if they keep up the pressure and run up the score or save their energy in the second half

-----

46': We're back!

50': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL UNITED STATES!!! *Sam Mewis* takes a shot, it takes a bad deflection and goes into the near side!**](https://streamja.com/XKA3)
